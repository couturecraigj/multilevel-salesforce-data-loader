# multilevel-salesforce-data-loader
This is a project intended to allow users to upload multiple tables of data based on one singular .csv this is a time saver for systems that have poor integration options
## Use Case
We are trying to load the data into salesforce for invoices, jobs and Customers.  These are different than Accounts, Contacts and Orders.  These rows of data are being generated by an external system and need to be loaded up dynamically.  This system actually is going to allow us to upload all the data based on one file.  The Hierarchy is below
Customer  
  L Job  
     L Invoice  
##The Process
* We pull data down from salesforce.com
  * For Customers
  * For Jobs
* We load the Customers from Salesforce.com into a local sqlite Table called Customers
* We load the Jobs from Salesforce.com into a local sqlite Table called Jobs
* We pull the data from the file that was added to the directory and insert all the rows into a Table called Invoices
  * We go through each line of the Invoice Table and attempt to add the Job information to the Job table or Ignore if it already exists
  * We go through each line of the Invoice Table and attempt to add the Customer information to the Customer Table or ignore if it alredy exists
* When the Invoice Table is finished processing attempt to load this data into salesforce starting with the Customer then the Job and then the Invoices... upon completion the system will then pull down all salesforce data onto the current users computer to reduce the load on the next attempted insert

## Alternate Process
* We are wanting to update existing data
  * We insert a file into the directory
  * We perform a Query from salesforce making sure we pull down all the existing data
  * We Update all the fields in the Table with the update information
  * We load the updated information into Salesforce.
